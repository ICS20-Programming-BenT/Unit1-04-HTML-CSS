    <h1>My experience at the OYJ provinvial swimming competition!</h1>
    <p>As part of of my competitive swimming life, I often attend competitions across Ontario and Quebec. Recently, between February 16 and February 19, I went to Toronto to attend the OYJ (Ontario Youth-Junior) championships. This was a provincial-level competition that I had qualified for in the winter, and it was amazing to have the opportunity to compete alongside some of the best swimmers in Ontario. </p>
